/**
 * Where the browser is allowed to write (AC-22, architecture §9.3, ADR-001 §9).
 *
 * Everything Chromium produces — its profile/user-data directory, the recording, downloads,
 * traces and its temporary files — lives under one of these names inside the **per-run** scratch
 * directory, which is created after admission and cleared on success, step failure, launch
 * failure, error and drain. `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` and a writable `/dev/shm` are honoured
 * by construction: nothing here writes anywhere else.
 *
 * Declared in its own module because both halves of the child boundary need it — the parent, to
 * point `TMPDIR` at the run's own temp directory before spawning, and `src/run/browser.ts`, to
 * place the profile and the recording — and the parent must not import the one module that
 * imports Playwright (AC-1).
 *
 * Resolved variables and secrets are never written to any of them (§9.2).
